	<h2>Research</h2>
	
	<p>I am a member of the University of Virginia Dependable Systems and Analytics Group 
		(<a href="https://homa-alem.github.io/research.html">UVA-DSA</a>). Our research focuses on the design and 
		validation of Resilient Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) with applications in surgical robotics, medical devices,
		and autonomous systems. </p>
		
	<p>My research focuses on improving the safety of robot-assisted surgery (RAS) by developing generalizable, objective, 
		and transparent methods for the analysis of surgical data. I am developing a formal framework for generalized 
		and hierarchical modeling of surgical activities and have created the COntext and Motion Primitive Aggregate 
		Surgical Set (<a href="https://github.com/UVA-DSA/COMPASS">COMPASS</a>). This dataset is used for fine-grained 
		activity recognition and runtime context inference, and can support surgeons during training and real operations 
		with error detection, skill assessment, and autonomy.</p>
